# Tic Tac Toe

I used the __Minimax algorithm__ to implement an __Artificially Intelligent__ tic tac toe game. I used __Vue Js__, a 
Javascript framework to implement the web app. I have used either React or basic HTML/CSS/JS for most 
of my front-end web development projects. Since this particular project fairly small and well-scoped, I wanted to explore 
something new -- hence Vue Js.

You can try the game [here](https://minimax-tic-tac-toe.herokuapp.com/)!


Read my notes on the Minimax algorithm and its run time [here]().
